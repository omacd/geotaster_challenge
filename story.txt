Once upon a time there was a fish called Brian. Brian wanted to make new friends so he bought a motorbike, but the other fish thought Brian was trying too hard. 

So then Brian <DID SOMETHING>, but the other fish thought Brian was <A DESCRIPTION OF BRIAN>. 
So then Brian spent a decade supporting all manner of GIS stuff, but the 
other fish thought Brian was still unemployable despite his incredible 
experience and new maturity so he had to spend the rest of his time 
practising github in order to become a data scientist and pay the bills.
